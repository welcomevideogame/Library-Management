# Library Management System

This Java application is a library management system that allows users to store and modify media data (e.g. books, movies, music) as well as employee information. It is built using the Java programming language and the Java Swing class for the user interface.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete media and employee records
- Sort and filter records by various criteria
- View statistics on media, employee, and usage data
- Manage user accounts and permissions

## Technologies and frameworks
- Java
- Java Swing

## Installation and usage
1. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Clone or download the repository
3. Import the project into your IDE
4. Run the main class to start the application

## Customization
To customize the application, you can modify the source code in the `src` directory.

## Target audience
This application is intended for libraries and other organizations that need to manage media and employee data. It is designed to be easy to use.

## Limitations
The current method for storing data is through .txt files. Though this may work for smaller libraries, this is most likely not the most secure method of storing data. However, customizing this to integrate with a database would be possible.
